# Web3 Impact Hackathon

Daring [shann.lens](https://twitter.com/shanvasion) to put their money where their mouth is and launch this thing today ðŸ˜˜.

Here's how OpenQ peer-to-peer, crowdfundable hackathons work.

It all starts on GitHub - that's where you make a good ole' hackathon repository. This is standard, Exhibit A from [EthBerlin](https://github.com/ethb3rlin/sponsor-bounties).

For each bounty, just make an issue.

Then that's where the âœ¨peer-to-peer trustless magicâœ¨ starts.

Head on over to [OpenQ](https://app.openq.dev) and click "New Contract"

Choose "Contest" for your bounty type. This will mint a crowdfundable hackathon!

Here, I made our first one: https://app.openq.dev/contract/I_kwDOIdGU6s5WpdRt/0x8fef118a279304165cdbf4c7a8ad0abd31dd8e1d

As you can see - 70% of the prize pool will go to 1st place, 20% to second place, and 10% to third place.

I deposited 10 USDC using the good ole' Approve and Transfer.

This deposit is timelocked for 30 days - it is in escrow

THIS IS ALL ON-CHAIN BY THE WAY! Like actually, here are our main contracts:

- 0xc5a775Bb945F6D573156d57b965F48C344dB582f
- 0x18f3400f8B4bC96EBBd1D40d86fbbAF4e00c469e
- 0x3Ca125a81646948b71bc8584F2d4C0000ad8C311

Submissions are simply pull requests that link to the bounties they would like to win.

Here's mine:
